## Learning Sanity

This repository is a collection of my learnings and experiments with Sanity.io.

Sanity is a platform for structured content that lets you manage your content with APIs and create custom editable user interfaces.

## What is Sanity?

Sanity is a platform for structured content that lets you manage your content with APIs and create custom editable user interfaces.

Sanity is built on top of Node.js, and it uses a schema-based approach to define the structure of your content. This makes it easy to manage large amounts of data and to create custom user interfaces for editing and displaying your content.

## Why Sanity?

I'm learning Sanity because it offers a unique combination of flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. With Sanity, I can create a custom content model that fits my needs, and then use that model to create custom user interfaces for editing and displaying my content.

Sanity also has a strong focus on developer experience, which makes it easy to get started and to build custom solutions for my content management needs.

## What am I learning?

I'm currently learning the basics of Sanity, including how to create a schema, how to create a custom user interface, and how to use the Sanity APIs to fetch and manipulate data.

I'm also experimenting with different ways of using Sanity to manage my content, such as using it to power a blog or to create a custom e-commerce platform.
